# Prediction-of-Bank-Note-original-Fake-
The problem is to predict the bank note is it original or fake. In this project, I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the note. I implement Decision Tree Classification with Python and sklearn. I have used the Bank Note Authentication Data Set for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.
